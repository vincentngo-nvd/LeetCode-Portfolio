# 🚀 LeetCode Portfolio - Duong Ngo Van

## ✨ Overview

This repository serves as a **Portfolio** showcasing my practice and solutions to various Data Structure and Algorithm (DSA) problems from LeetCode. The primary goal is to **demonstrate strong problem-solving skills**.

## 🎯 Goals

* **Proof of Competency:** To apply fundamental data structures (Arrays, Hash Maps, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs) and common algorithms (Search, Sort, Dynamic Programming).
* **Optimization Focus:** Always strive for the most optimal solution in terms of **Time Complexity** ($O(T)$) and **Space Complexity** ($O(S)$).
* **Documentation:** Clearly document the approach, and final optimized results for key problems.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Solutions are organized logically by language and the main data structure/algorithm involved: `Language/Data_Structure/LeetCode-ID_Problem-Name-Abbreviated`.

**Example:**

* `Python/Arrays/0001_Two_Sum/solution.py`

## 💡 Highlighted Problems

Here are some solved problems, focusing on critical techniques and optimized solutions:

| ID | Problem Title | Key Technique/Structure | Complexity (Optimal) | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0001** | **Two Sum** | Hash Map | $O(N)$ Time, $O(N)$ Space | [Link Solution](Python/Arrays/0001_Two_Sum/solution.py) |
